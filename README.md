Screen 2 - Main Game: Navigation
Show a minimap and enable navigation of the character. It should be a dungeon-like RPG, where rooms are explored sequentially and after exploration of each room, more of the dungeon is opened up. At each room, either a battle, shop, or a random event would appear. There is an end room, which leads you down the next level underground. The dungeon goes deeper and deeper and does not end.
Right before a main boss, there should be a shop which also functions as a save point.

Screen 3 - Main Game: Battle
This is where the battle takes place. It is a turn-based battle where the monster (only 1) and player take turns to attack each other.
Players have HP, MP, ATK, DEF, Mag Atk and Mag Def, and are able to use either Attack or Item or Spell
Spells are learned as the player levels up.
Attack is based on ATK of player - DEF of enemy

Items are picked up from battles.
Players gain EXP and gold after each battle.
When levelled up, player has 5 attribute points to distribute across: HP, MP, ATK, DEF, Mag Atk and Mag Def
